## Development

Mbaza is based on [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate),
which uses
[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/),
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router),
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[React Fast Refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh).

Useful files (sample data, biomonitoring stations, icons)
can be found on our [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQWuf5WCT429xogQ2HiZqapehvweAtxP) (Appsilon internal).
